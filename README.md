# pyvista-docs

This is the root Site for hosting our documentation on Netlify (https://pyvista-docs.netlify.app)

Changes to the documentation should not be made here but rather in the
[PyVista](https://github.com/pyvista/pyvista) repository.

If you have any questions about this repository, feel free to ping
[@banesullivan](https://github.com/banesullivan) as he originally implemented
this hosting service for the PyVista documentation.

Or feel free to contact [@akaszynski](https://github.com/akaszynski).
